[LG V40, Galaxy S9+]
Unfortunately, I could not reproduce the issue (working weird when I disconnect on peripheral side)

Instead, I captured other weird issue, which they 

*****keep CONNECT then DISCONNECT >>>SEVERAL TIMES<<< before they really connect*****

This issue happens all the time (especially w/ V40)


If I need to open up a new session for this question, plz lemme know!
